/* Properties for the Parent */
.container {
    /*  */
    display: flex; /* or inline-flex */ /* initialize on main container. All siblings become flex items */
        This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children
    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;

        row; default. Use column for children to be columns. Switch access.
        This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.
    /* Both have main access. When row, it is "main access" from left to right. When it is column, it is "cross acis" that goes from top to bottom. */
    flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse; /* default. */
        By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property. Direction also plays a role here, determining the direction new lines are stacked in.

    flex-flow:
        This is a shorthand flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex containers main and cross axes. Default is row nowrap

    justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around;
        This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.
        flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start line
        flex-end: items are packed toward to end line
        center: items are centered along the line
        space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
        space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces arent equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.

    need min-height if flex-direction is column

    align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
    /* default. Similar to justify content. On cross-access and needs a height to work*/
        center: vertically centers
        flex-start: cross-start margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-start line
        flex-end: cross-end margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-end line
        center: items are centered in the cross-axis
        baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align. Very helpful.
        stretch (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)

    align-content: space-between; /* By default, it is stretch */
        This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
        Note: this property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items.
        flex-start: lines packed to the start of the container
        flex-end: lines packed to the end of the container
        center: lines packed to the center of the container
        space-between: lines evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
        space-around: lines evenly distributed with equal space around each line
        stretch (default): lines stretch to take up the remaining space
}

/* Properties for the Child */
.box { /* child element */
    width: 33.333%; /* divides into 3 columns  */
    margin: /* Doesnt fit box model. Dont use.  */
    padding: use padding
    flex: 1;
    order: 1; /* can override the default of 0 to help with ordering children */
    justify-content:
        flex-start; /* Default. Wheere content is according to parent. space-between: divides up nicely. space-around: Puts space on left and right */
        flex-end:
        center: vertically align
        space-around: a number of different divieing up of space
        sace-between: ""
}

.box3 {
    order: 5; /* default is 1. Adding a number orders it accordingly. Can use negetives. Works sort of like z-index */
}

/* from guide */

.item {
  order: <integer>;
}
By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

.item {
  flex-grow: <number>; /* default 0 */
}
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

.item {
  flex-shrink: <number>; /* default 1 */
}
This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.

.item {
  flex-basis: <length> | auto; /* default auto */
}
This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means "look at my width or height property" (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means "size it based on the item's content" - this keyword isn't well supported yet, so it's hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.

.item {
  flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
}
This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. Default is 0 1 auto.

.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}
This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.

Please see the align-items explanation to understand the available values.
