    The museum of incredible dull things

    The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

    However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

    Task

    Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

    Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

    Examples

    removeSmallest([1,2,3,4,5]) = [2,3,4,5]
    removeSmallest([5,3,2,1,4]) = [5,3,2,4]
    removeSmallest([2,2,1,2,1]) = [2,2,2,1]

-----------

    function removeSmallest(numbers) {
        if(numbers.length === 0 || numbers.length === 1) return [];
            min = Math.min.apply(null,numbers);
            var index = numbers.indexOf(min);

            if(index > -1) {
                numbers.splice(index, 1);
          }

          return numbers
    }

    console.log(removeSmallest([4,12,3,5,7,10,5,6]));
---------------
    Implement the following methods:

    Object.prototype.random(): returns randomly one of the values of the object.

    For example:

    var obj = {
        a: 1,
        b: {
            x: 2,
            y: 3
        },
        c: {
            z: {
                q: 4
            }
        }
    };

    obj.random(); //returns 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. All values have the same probability to be returned

    obj = {};

    obj.random(); //returns undefined
    Object.prototype.toRandomArray(): returns an array of the random values.

    For example,

    var obj = {
        a: 1,
        b: {
            x: 2,
            y: 3
        },
        c: {
            z: {
                q: 4
            }
        }
    };

    obj.toRandomArray(); //returns a random permutation of [1, 2, 3, 4]

    obj = {};

    obj.toRandomArray(); //returns []
