    var obj = {
      name: 'Carrot',
      'for': 'Max',
      details: {
        color: 'orange',
        size: 12
      }
    }

    //Attribute access can be chained together:
    obj.details.color; //orange
    obj['detailt']['size']; //12

    //The following example creates an object prototype, Person, and instance of that prototype, You.
    function Person(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }

    // Define an object
    var You = new Person("You", 24);
    // We are creating a new person named "You"
    // (that was the first parameter, and the age..)

    //Once created, an object's properties can again be accessed in one of two ways:
    obj.name = 'Simon';
    var name = obj.name;
    //and
    obj['name'] = 'Simon';
    var name = obj['name'];


    //Arrays in JavaScript are actually a special type of object. They work very much like regular objects (numerical properties can naturally be accessed only using [] syntax) but they have one magic property called 'length'. This is always one more than the highest index in the array.

    var a = ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'];
    a.lenght; //3

    var a = ["dog", "cat", "hen"];
    a[100] = "fox";
    a.length; // 101

    //Remember — the length of the array is one more than the highest index.
    //If you query a non-existent array index, you'll get a value of undefined returned:
    typeof a[90]; // undefined

    //If you take the above into account, you can iterate over an array using the following:
    for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
      // Do something with a[i]
    }

    //Another way of iterating over an array that was added with ECMAScript 5 is forEach():

    ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'].forEach(function(currentValue, index, array) {
      //do something with currentValue or array[index]
    });

    //If you want to append an item to an array simply do it like this:
    a.push(item);

    //Array methods
    a.toString(); // Returns a string of each element separated by commas.
    a.concat(item1[, item2[, ...[,itemN]]]) // Returns a new array with the items added onto it.
    a.join(sep) //Converts the array to a string with values deliminited by the sep param.
    a.pop() //Removes and returns the last item.
    a.push(item1, ..., itemN) //Adds one or more items to the end.
    a.reverse() //Reverses the array
    a.shift() // Removes and returns the first item.
    a.slice(start[, end]) //Returns a sub array
    a.sort([cmpfn]) //Take an optional comparison function.
    a.splice(start, delcount[, item1[, ...[, itemN]]]) //Lets you modify an array by deleting a section and replacing it with more items
    a.unshift(item1[, item2[, ...[, itemN]]]) //Prepends items to the start of the array.

    //Functions
    //This demonstrates a basic function. A JavaScript function can take 0 or more named parameters. The function body can contain as many statements as you like, and can declare its own variables which are local to that function. The return statement can be used to return a value at any time, terminating the function. If no return statement is used (or an empty return with no value), JavaScript returns undefined.
    function add(x, y) {
      var total = x + y;
      return total;
    }

    add(); // NaN
    // You can't perform addition on undefined

    //You can also pass in more arguments than the function is expecting:
    add(2, 3, 4); // 5
    // added the first two; 4 was ignored

    //That may seem a little silly, but functions have access to an additional variable inside their body called arguments, which is an array-like object holding all of the values passed to the function. Let's re-write the add function to take as many values as we want:
    function add() {
      var sum = 0;
      for (var i = 0; j = arguments.lenght; i < j; i++) {
        sum += arguments[i];
      }
      return sum;
    }
    add(2,3,4,5); //14

    //averaging function
    function avg() {
      var sum = 0;
      for (var i = 0; j = arguments.length; i < j; i++) {
        sum += arguments[i];
      }
      return sum / arguments.length;
    }
    avg(2,3,4,5); //3.5

    //This is pretty useful, but it does seem a little verbose. To diminish this code a bit more we can look at substituting the use of the arguments array through Spread syntax. In this way we can pass in any number of arguments into the function while keeping our code minimal. The spread operator is used in function declarations with the format: ...[variable]  and it will include within that variable the entire list of uncaptured arguments that the function was called with.  We will also replace the for loop with a for...of loop to return the values within our variable.

    function avg(...args) {
      var sum = 0;
      for (let value of args) {
        sum += value;
      }
      return sum / args/length;
    }
    avg(2,3,4,5); //3.5
    //In the above code the variable args holds all the values that were passed into the function. It is important to note that wherever the spread operator is placed in a function declaration it will store all arguments after its declaration, but not before.
    //a.e. function avg(firstValue, ...args) will store the first value passed into the function in the firstValue variable and the remaining arguments in args.

    // JavaScript lets you create anonymous functions.
    var avg = function() {
    var sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0, j = arguments.length; i < j; i++) {
      sum += arguments[i];
    }
    return sum / arguments.length;
    };

    //This is semantically equivalent to the function avg() form. It's extremely powerful, as it lets you put a full function definition anywhere that you would normally put an expression. This enables all sorts of clever tricks. Here's a way of "hiding" some local variables — like block scope in C:
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;

    (function() {
      var b = 3;
      a += b;
    })();
    a; // 4
    b; // 2

    //This highlights a potential problem with anonymous functions: how do you call them recursively if they don't have a name? JavaScript lets you name function expressions for this. You can use named IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) as shown below:

    var charsInBody = (function counter(elm) {
    if (elm.nodeType == 3) { // TEXT_NODE
      return elm.nodeValue.length;
    }
    var count = 0;
    for (var i = 0, child; child = elm.childNodes[i]; i++) {
      count += counter(child);
    }
    return count;
  })(document.body);
  //The name provided to a function expression as above is only available to the function's own scope. This allows more optimizations to be done by the engine and results in more readable code. The name also shows up in the debugger and some stack traces, which can save you time when debugging.

  //In classic Object Oriented Programming, objects are collections of data and methods that operate on that data. JavaScript is a prototype-based language that contains no class statement, as you'd find in C++ or Java (this is sometimes confusing for programmers accustomed to languages with a class statement.) Instead, JavaScript uses functions as classes. Let's consider a person object with first and last name fields. There are two ways in which the name might be displayed: as "first last" or as "last, first". Using the functions and objects that we've discussed previously, we could display the data like this:

  function makePerson(first, last) {
  return {
    first: first,
    last: last
    };
  }
  function personFullName(person) {
    return person.first + ' ' + person.last;
  }
  function personFullNameReversed(person) {
    return person.last + ', ' + person.first;
  }

  s = makePerson("Simon", "Willison");
  personFullName(s); // "Simon Willison"
  personFullNameReversed(s); // "Willison, Simon"

  // This works, but it's pretty ugly. You end up with dozens of functions in your global namespace. What we really need is a way to attach a function to an object. Since functions are objects, this is easy:

  function makePerson(first, last) {
    return {
      first: first,
      last: last,
      fullName: function () {
        return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
      },
      fullNameReversed: function() {
        return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
      }
    };
  }
  s = makePerson('simon', 'Willison')
  s.fullName(); // 'Simon Willison'
  s.fullNameReversed(); // 'Willison, Simon'

  //There's something here we haven't seen before: the this keyword. Used inside a function, this refers to the current object. What that actually means is specified by the way in which you called that function. If you called it using dot notation or bracket notation on an object, that object becomes this. If dot notation wasn't used for the call, this refers to the global object.

  s = makePerson("Simon", "Willison");
  var fullName = s.fullName;
  fullName(); // undefined undefined

  //When we call fullName() alone, without using s.fullName(), this is bound to the global object. Since there are no global variables called first or last we get undefined for each one.
  //We can take advantage of the this keyword to improve our makePerson function:

  function Person(first, last) {
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
    this.fullName = function() {
      return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
    };
    this.fullNameReversed = function() {
      return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
    };
  }
  var s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");

  //We have introduced another keyword: new. new is strongly related to this. It creates a brand new empty object, and then calls the function specified, with this set to that new object. Notice though that the function specified with this does not return a value but merely modifies the this object. It's new that returns the this object to the calling site. Functions that are designed to be called by new are called constructor functions. Common practice is to capitalize these functions as a reminder to call them with new.
 //The improved function still has the same pitfall with calling fullName() alone.
 //Our person objects are getting better, but there are still some ugly edges to them. Every time we create a person object we are creating two brand new function objects within it — wouldn't it be better if this code was shared?
  function personFullName() {
    return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
  }
  function personFullNameReversed() {
    return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
  }
  function Person(first, last) {
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
    this.fullName = personFullName;
    this.fullNameReversed = personFullNameReversed;
  }

  //That's better: we are creating the method functions only once, and assigning references to them inside the constructor. Can we do any better than that? The answer is yes:

  function Person(first, last) {
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
  }
  Person.prototype.fullName = function() {
    return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
  };
  Person.prototype.fullNameReversed = function() {
    return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
  };

  //Person.prototype is an object shared by all instances of Person. It forms part of a lookup chain (that has a special name, "prototype chain"): any time you attempt to access a property of Person that isn't set, JavaScript will check Person.prototype to see if that property exists there instead. As a result, anything assigned to Person.prototype becomes available to all instances of that constructor via the this object.

  //This is an incredibly powerful tool. JavaScript lets you modify something's prototype at any time in your program, which means you can add extra methods to existing objects at runtime:
  s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");
  s.firstNameCaps(); // TypeError on line 1: s.firstNameCaps is not a function

  Person.prototype.firstNameCaps = function firstNameCaps() {
    return this.first.toUpperCase()
  };
  s.firstNameCaps(); // "SIMON"

  //Interestingly, you can also add things to the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects. Let's add a method to String that returns that string in reverse:
  var s = "Simon";
  s.reversed(); // TypeError on line 1: s.reversed is not a function

  String.prototype.reversed = function reversed() {
    var r = "";
    for (var i = this.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      r += this[i];
    }
    return r;
  };

  s.reversed(); // nomiS
  //Our new method even works on string literals!
  "This can now be reversed".reversed(); // desrever eb won nac sihT

  //As mentioned before, the prototype forms part of a chain. The root of that chain isObject.prototype, whose methods include toString() — it is this method that is called when you try to represent an object as a string. This is useful for debugging our Person objects:
  var s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");
  s; // [object Object]

  Person.prototype.toString = function() {
    return '<Person: ' + this.fullName() + '>';
  }

  s.toString(); // "<Person: Simon Willison>"
  //Remember how avg.apply() had a null first argument? We can revisit that now. The first argument toapply() is the object that should be treated as 'this'. For example, here's a trivial implementation ofnew:
  function trivialNew(constructor, ...args) {
    var o = {}; // Create an object
    constructor.apply(o, args);
    return o;
  }
  //This isn't an exact replica of new as it doesn't set up the prototype chain (it would be difficult to illustrate). This is not something you use very often, but it's useful to know about. In this snippet,...args (including the ellipsis) is called the "rest arguments" — as the name implies, this contains the rest of the arguments.

  //Calling
  var bill = trivialNew(Person, "William", "Orange");
  //is therefore almost equivalent to
  var bill = new Person("William", "Orange");
  //apply() has a sister function named call, which again lets you set this but takes an expanded argument list as opposed to an array.
  function lastNameCaps() {
    return this.last.toUpperCase();
  }
  var s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");
  lastNameCaps.call(s);
  // Is the same as:
  s.lastNameCaps = lastNameCaps;
  s.lastNameCaps();

  //Inner functions
 //JavaScript function declarations are allowed inside other functions. We've seen this once before, with an earlier makePerson() function. An important detail of nested functions in JavaScript is that they can access variables in their parent function's scope:
  function betterExampleNeeded() {
    var a = 1;
    function oneMoreThanA() {
      return a + 1;
    }
    return oneMoreThanA();
  }
  //This provides a great deal of utility in writing more maintainable code. If a function relies on one or two other functions that are not useful to any other part of your code, you can nest those utility functions inside the function that will be called from elsewhere. This keeps the number of functions that are in the global scope down, which is always a good thing.

  //This is also a great counter to the lure of global variables. When writing complex code it is often tempting to use global variables to share values between multiple functions — which leads to code that is hard to maintain. Nested functions can share variables in their parent, so you can use that mechanism to couple functions together when it makes sense without polluting your global namespace — "local globals" if you like. This technique should be used with caution, but it's a useful ability to have.

        //do something with currentValue or array[index]
      });

      //If you want to append an item to an array simply do it like this:
      a.push(item);

      //Array methods
      a.toString(); // Returns a string of each element separated by commas.
      a.concat(item1[, item2[, ...[,itemN]]]) // Returns a new array with the items added onto it.
      a.join(sep) //Converts the array to a string with values deliminited by the sep param.
      a.pop() //Removes and returns the last item.
      a.push(item1, ..., itemN) //Adds one or more items to the end.
      a.reverse() //Reverses the array
      a.shift() // Removes and returns the first item.
      a.slice(start[, end]) //Returns a sub array
      a.sort([cmpfn]) //Take an optional comparison function.
      a.splice(start, delcount[, item1[, ...[, itemN]]]) //Lets you modify an array by deleting a section and replacing it with more items
      a.unshift(item1[, item2[, ...[, itemN]]]) //Prepends items to the start of the array.

      //Functions
      //This demonstrates a basic function. A JavaScript function can take 0 or more named parameters. The function body can contain as many statements as you like, and can declare its own variables which are local to that function. The return statement can be used to return a value at any time, terminating the function. If no return statement is used (or an empty return with no value), JavaScript returns undefined.
      function add(x, y) {
        var total = x + y;
        return total;
      }

      add(); // NaN
      // You can't perform addition on undefined

      //You can also pass in more arguments than the function is expecting:
      add(2, 3, 4); // 5
      // added the first two; 4 was ignored

      //That may seem a little silly, but functions have access to an additional variable inside their body called arguments, which is an array-like object holding all of the values passed to the function. Let's re-write the add function to take as many values as we want:
      function add() {
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 0; j = arguments.lenght; i < j; i++) {
          sum += arguments[i];
        }
        return sum;
      }
      add(2,3,4,5); //14

      //averaging function
      function avg() {
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 0; j = arguments.length; i < j; i++) {
          sum += arguments[i];
        }
        return sum / arguments.length;
      }
      avg(2,3,4,5); //3.5

      //This is pretty useful, but it does seem a little verbose. To diminish this code a bit more we can look at substituting the use of the arguments array through Spread syntax. In this way we can pass in any number of arguments into the function while keeping our code minimal. The spread operator is used in function declarations with the format: ...[variable]  and it will include within that variable the entire list of uncaptured arguments that the function was called with.  We will also replace the for loop with a for...of loop to return the values within our variable.

      function avg(...args) {
        var sum = 0;
        for (let value of args) {
          sum += value;
        }
        return sum / args/length;
      }
      avg(2,3,4,5); //3.5
      //In the above code the variable args holds all the values that were passed into the function. It is important to note that wherever the spread operator is placed in a function declaration it will store all arguments after its declaration, but not before.
      //a.e. function avg(firstValue, ...args) will store the first value passed into the function in the firstValue variable and the remaining arguments in args.

      // JavaScript lets you create anonymous functions.
      var avg = function() {
      var sum = 0;
      for (var i = 0, j = arguments.length; i < j; i++) {
        sum += arguments[i];
      }
      return sum / arguments.length;
      };

      //This is semantically equivalent to the function avg() form. It's extremely powerful, as it lets you put a full function definition anywhere that you would normally put an expression. This enables all sorts of clever tricks. Here's a way of "hiding" some local variables — like block scope in C:
      var a = 1;
      var b = 2;

      (function() {
        var b = 3;
        a += b;
      })();
      a; // 4
      b; // 2

      //This highlights a potential problem with anonymous functions: how do you call them recursively if they don't have a name? JavaScript lets you name function expressions for this. You can use named IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) as shown below:

      var charsInBody = (function counter(elm) {
      if (elm.nodeType == 3) { // TEXT_NODE
        return elm.nodeValue.length;
      }
      var count = 0;
      for (var i = 0, child; child = elm.childNodes[i]; i++) {
        count += counter(child);
      }
      return count;
    })(document.body);
    //The name provided to a function expression as above is only available to the function's own scope. This allows more optimizations to be done by the engine and results in more readable code. The name also shows up in the debugger and some stack traces, which can save you time when debugging.

    //In classic Object Oriented Programming, objects are collections of data and methods that operate on that data. JavaScript is a prototype-based language that contains no class statement, as you'd find in C++ or Java (this is sometimes confusing for programmers accustomed to languages with a class statement.) Instead, JavaScript uses functions as classes. Let's consider a person object with first and last name fields. There are two ways in which the name might be displayed: as "first last" or as "last, first". Using the functions and objects that we've discussed previously, we could display the data like this:

    function makePerson(first, last) {
    return {
      first: first,
      last: last
      };
    }
    function personFullName(person) {
      return person.first + ' ' + person.last;
    }
    function personFullNameReversed(person) {
      return person.last + ', ' + person.first;
    }

    s = makePerson("Simon", "Willison");
    personFullName(s); // "Simon Willison"
    personFullNameReversed(s); // "Willison, Simon"

    // This works, but it's pretty ugly. You end up with dozens of functions in your global namespace. What we really need is a way to attach a function to an object. Since functions are objects, this is easy:

    function makePerson(first, last) {
      return {
        first: first,
        last: last,
        fullName: function () {
          return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
        },
        fullNameReversed: function() {
          return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
        }
      };
    }
    s = makePerson('simon', 'Willison')
    s.fullName(); // 'Simon Willison'
    s.fullNameReversed(); // 'Willison, Simon'

    //There's something here we haven't seen before: the this keyword. Used inside a function, this refers to the current object. What that actually means is specified by the way in which you called that function. If you called it using dot notation or bracket notation on an object, that object becomes this. If dot notation wasn't used for the call, this refers to the global object.

    s = makePerson("Simon", "Willison");
    var fullName = s.fullName;
    fullName(); // undefined undefined

    //When we call fullName() alone, without using s.fullName(), this is bound to the global object. Since there are no global variables called first or last we get undefined for each one.
    //We can take advantage of the this keyword to improve our makePerson function:

    function Person(first, last) {
      this.first = first;
      this.last = last;
      this.fullName = function() {
        return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
      };
      this.fullNameReversed = function() {
        return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
      };
    }
    var s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");

    //We have introduced another keyword: new. new is strongly related to this. It creates a brand new empty object, and then calls the function specified, with this set to that new object. Notice though that the function specified with this does not return a value but merely modifies the this object. It's new that returns the this object to the calling site. Functions that are designed to be called by new are called constructor functions. Common practice is to capitalize these functions as a reminder to call them with new.
   //The improved function still has the same pitfall with calling fullName() alone.
   //Our person objects are getting better, but there are still some ugly edges to them. Every time we create a person object we are creating two brand new function objects within it — wouldn't it be better if this code was shared?
    function personFullName() {
      return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
    }
    function personFullNameReversed() {
      return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
    }
    function Person(first, last) {
      this.first = first;
      this.last = last;
      this.fullName = personFullName;
      this.fullNameReversed = personFullNameReversed;
    }

    //That's better: we are creating the method functions only once, and assigning references to them inside the constructor. Can we do any better than that? The answer is yes:

    function Person(first, last) {
      this.first = first;
      this.last = last;
    }
    Person.prototype.fullName = function() {
      return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
    };
    Person.prototype.fullNameReversed = function() {
      return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
    };

    //Person.prototype is an object shared by all instances of Person. It forms part of a lookup chain (that has a special name, "prototype chain"): any time you attempt to access a property of Person that isn't set, JavaScript will check Person.prototype to see if that property exists there instead. As a result, anything assigned to Person.prototype becomes available to all instances of that constructor via the this object.

    //This is an incredibly powerful tool. JavaScript lets you modify something's prototype at any time in your program, which means you can add extra methods to existing objects at runtime:
    s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");
    s.firstNameCaps(); // TypeError on line 1: s.firstNameCaps is not a function

    Person.prototype.firstNameCaps = function firstNameCaps() {
      return this.first.toUpperCase()
    };
    s.firstNameCaps(); // "SIMON"

    //Interestingly, you can also add things to the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects. Let's add a method to String that returns that string in reverse:
    var s = "Simon";
    s.reversed(); // TypeError on line 1: s.reversed is not a function

    String.prototype.reversed = function reversed() {
      var r = "";
      for (var i = this.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        r += this[i];
      }
      return r;
    };

    s.reversed(); // nomiS
    //Our new method even works on string literals!
    "This can now be reversed".reversed(); // desrever eb won nac sihT

    //As mentioned before, the prototype forms part of a chain. The root of that chain isObject.prototype, whose methods include toString() — it is this method that is called when you try to represent an object as a string. This is useful for debugging our Person objects:
    var s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");
    s; // [object Object]

    Person.prototype.toString = function() {
      return '<Person: ' + this.fullName() + '>';
    }

    s.toString(); // "<Person: Simon Willison>"
    //Remember how avg.apply() had a null first argument? We can revisit that now. The first argument toapply() is the object that should be treated as 'this'. For example, here's a trivial implementation ofnew:
    function trivialNew(constructor, ...args) {
      var o = {}; // Create an object
      constructor.apply(o, args);
      return o;
    }
    //This isn't an exact replica of new as it doesn't set up the prototype chain (it would be difficult to illustrate). This is not something you use very often, but it's useful to know about. In this snippet,...args (including the ellipsis) is called the "rest arguments" — as the name implies, this contains the rest of the arguments.

    //Calling
    var bill = trivialNew(Person, "William", "Orange");
    //is therefore almost equivalent to
    var bill = new Person("William", "Orange");
    //apply() has a sister function named call, which again lets you set this but takes an expanded argument list as opposed to an array.
    function lastNameCaps() {
      return this.last.toUpperCase();
    }
    var s = new Person("Simon", "Willison");
    lastNameCaps.call(s);
    // Is the same as:
    s.lastNameCaps = lastNameCaps;
    s.lastNameCaps();

    //Inner functions
   //JavaScript function declarations are allowed inside other functions. We've seen this once before, with an earlier makePerson() function. An important detail of nested functions in JavaScript is that they can access variables in their parent function's scope:
    function betterExampleNeeded() {
      var a = 1;
      function oneMoreThanA() {
        return a + 1;
      }
      return oneMoreThanA();
    }
    //This provides a great deal of utility in writing more maintainable code. If a function relies on one or two other functions that are not useful to any other part of your code, you can nest those utility functions inside the function that will be called from elsewhere. This keeps the number of functions that are in the global scope down, which is always a good thing.

    //This is also a great counter to the lure of global variables. When writing complex code it is often tempting to use global variables to share values between multiple functions — which leads to code that is hard to maintain. Nested functions can share variables in their parent, so you can use that mechanism to couple functions together when it makes sense without polluting your global namespace — "local globals" if you like. This technique should be used with caution, but it's a useful ability to have.

    //Closures
    //This leads us to one of the most powerful abstractions that JavaScript has to offer — but also the most potentially confusing. What does this do?
    function makeAdder(a) {
      return function(b) {
        return a + b;
      };
    }
    var x = makeAdder(5);
    var y = makeAdder(20);
    x(6); // ?
    y(7); // ?
    //The name of the makeAdder() function should give it away: it creates a new 'adder' functions, which when called with one argument adds it to the argument that they were created with.

    //What's happening here is pretty much the same as was happening with the inner functions earlier on: a function defined inside another function has access to the outer function's variables. The only difference here is that the outer function has returned, and hence common sense would seem to dictate that its local variables no longer exist. But they do still exist — otherwise the adder functions would be unable to work. What's more, there are two different "copies" of makeAdder()'s local variables — one in which a is 5 and one in which a is 20. So the result of those function calls is as follows:
    x(6); // returns 11
    y(7); // returns 27
    //Here's what's actually happening. Whenever JavaScript executes a function, a 'scope' object is created to hold the local variables created within that function. It is initialized with any variables passed in as function parameters. This is similar to the global object that all global variables and functions live in, but with a couple of important differences: firstly, a brand new scope object is created every time a function starts executing, and secondly, unlike the global object (which is accessible as this and in browsers as window) these scope objects cannot be directly accessed from your JavaScript code. There is no mechanism for iterating over the properties of the current scope object, for example.
    //So when makeAdder() is called, a scope object is created with one property: a, which is the argument passed to the makeAdder() function. makeAdder() then returns a newly created function. Normally JavaScript's garbage collector would clean up the scope object created for makeAdder() at this point, but the returned function maintains a reference back to that scope object. As a result, the scope object will not be garbage collected until there are no more references to the function object thatmakeAdder() returned.
    //Scope objects form a chain called the scope chain, similar to the prototype chain used by JavaScript's object system.
    //A closure is the combination of a function and the scope object in which it was created. Closures let you save state — as such, they can often be used in place of objects. You can find several excellent introductions to closures.
