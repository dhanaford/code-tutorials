/*
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

DNAStrand ("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"

DNAStrand ("GTAT") # return "CATA"
*/

function DNAStrand(dna){


	var complements = new Map ([['G','C'],['C','G'],['T','A'],['A','T']]);

	var DNAStrand = dna => dna.split('').map(x => complements.get(x)).join('');
	return DNAStrand;

}

console.log(DNAStrand("AAAA"));
